# ADE Demo Suite
This repository is a **public, self-contained vision demo** of the ADE (Arkhon Development Environment) stack, developed by **ADE Cubed Inc.**, a Delaware corporation.
It shows, in a scripted and deterministic way:
- a mini **Console** for ADE-style commands,
- an **Observer** that spots repetitive patterns,
- a **Forge** planner that returns small demo plans,
- a **Memory** engine that stores and retrieves notes,
- a **Chat + approval loop** where actions run only after explicit approval.
This is a **VISION DEMO**, not a production-ready product.
All behavior is implemented via local stubs and JSON scenarios; no real services or files are touched.
For details, see:
