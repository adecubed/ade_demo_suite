# ADE Demo Suite — DEMO Guide
This guide explains how to run the ADE Demo Suite locally and how to trigger the main scripted scenarios.
The goal is to let you explore the demo safely on your machine, without requiring any prior knowledge of ADE or its internal codebase.
---
## 1. Prerequisites
You need:
- Python 3.10+ with `pip`
- Node.js + npm (for the UI)
- A terminal (bash, zsh, or PowerShell)
From the root of this folder (`demo_github/ade-demo-suite`), install backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```
For the UI, install dependencies once:
```bash
cd ui
npm install
cd ..
```
No other tools or external services are required. Everything runs locally.
---
## 2. Start the demo (backend + UI)
The demo is split into:
- a **backend** (FastAPI) that exposes HTTP endpoints under `/api/*`,
- a **UI** (Vite + React) that talks to those endpoints.
Both are started by helper scripts.
### 2.1. Linux / macOS
From `demo_github/ade-demo-suite`:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run-demo.sh
./scripts/run-demo.sh
```
This script will:
- set `DEMO_MODE=1`,
- start the FastAPI backend on `http://127.0.0.1:${ADE_DEMO_PORT:-8001}`,
- start the Vite UI dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
Once both are running, open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173` in your browser.
### 2.2. Windows (PowerShell)
From `demo_github/ade-demo-suite`:
```powershell
.\scripts\run-demo.ps1
# or with a custom port:
.\scripts\run-demo.ps1 -Port 8001
```
This script will:
- set `DEMO_MODE=1`,
- start the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:<Port>`,
- start the Vite UI dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
Then open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173` in your browser.
If something fails (missing Python/Node, port already in use), the scripts print simple error messages in the terminal.
---
## 3. Using the UI
When you open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, you will see a small console-like interface with four main tabs:
- **Console**
  - send demo commands to the backend,
  - see structured output and a short history.
- **Observer**
  - see a list of events (timeline),
  - see suggestions generated by the Observer stub.
- **Forge**
  - create and run small demo plans,
  - see plan status and steps.
- **Memory**
  - write memory items (key + content + tags),
  - query memory and see matching items.
There is also a **“Run Guided Demo”** button in the header that focuses on the Observer scenario and opens a narrative overlay.
You can click around freely: all actions are local and safe.
---
## 4. Running the scripted scenarios
The demo includes three scripted scenarios under `demo/scenarios/`. They are replayed by `demo/demo_runner.py`.
Make sure backend + UI are running, then from `demo_github/ade-demo-suite` run:
```bash
# Scenario 1 — Observer workflow
python demo/demo_runner.py --scenario observer
# Scenario 2 — Forge plan
python demo/demo_runner.py --scenario forge
# Scenario 3 — Memory recall
python demo/demo_runner.py --scenario memory
```
What to watch:
- For `observer`:
  - open the **Observer** tab,
  - you will see events appear in the timeline and a suggestion in the suggestions list.
- For `forge`:
  - open the **Forge** tab,
  - you will see a small plan with a few steps and a final status.
- For `memory`:
  - open the **Memory** tab,
  - you will see memory items being written and then retrieved by a query.
The scenarios are deterministic: running them again produces the same sequence of events.
---
## 5. Guided Demo — Observer scenario
The Guided Demo is a more narrative version of the Observer scenario.
Steps:
1. Start backend + UI (see section 2).
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173` in your browser.
3. Click **“Run Guided Demo”** in the header.
This will:
- switch the active tab to **Observer**,
- open a modal overlay with a short story (timeline),
- start a small, simulated conversation in the Chat tab.
To see the live events and suggestions that match the story:
```bash
python demo/demo_runner.py --scenario observer
```
Then watch the **Observer** tab:
- the events list will fill with entries (file edits, commands, hints),
- a suggestion will appear (for example, to automate a repetitive restart flow).
For a detailed explanation of what you are seeing, read:
- `README_guided_demo_observer.md`

## 6. Safety notes
The demo is designed to be safe and predictable:
- it runs in **DEMO_MODE=1**,
- all behavior is scripted and deterministic,
- no real services, containers or configuration files on your machine are modified,
- no external network calls are made.
You can inspect the stub implementations under `backend/stubs/` and the scenario JSON files under `demo/scenarios/` to see exactly what happens.
Use this demo to explore the **experience** and to discuss ideas. It is not intended for production use.
